# Postrobot - Turtlebot3
In this repository you can find the code of the project of the subject "Mobile Robots" of the Robotics Degree of the University of Alicante.

# Description
This project consists of a robot that has to move around a map and deliver a package to a specific point. The robot has to avoid obstacles and follow the path to the destination. In the meantime, the robot patrols the map going from one point to another.

# Installation

In order to install this package, you need run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pabloo05/postrobot-turtlebot.git
cd postrobot-turtlebot
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

# Usage

In order to use this package, you need to run the following commands:
```bash
roslaunch core turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml
rosrun map_server map_server map.yaml
python3 src/core/scripts/main.py
```
## Delivery mode
To use the delivery mode, you must post a message in the "delivery" topic with the name of the destination point. For example
```bash
rostopic pub /delivery std_msgs/String "data: 'o1'"
```
With this command, the robot will go to point "o1" and deliver the package.

## Patrol mode
Patrol mode is activated while the robot is not delivering any packages. The robot will go from one point to another to patrol the map.
